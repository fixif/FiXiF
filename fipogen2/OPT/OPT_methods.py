"""
This metaclass is base for optimization of SIFs

Each SIF coming from different origins have differents manners of undergoing the same treatments, namely optimization.

__metaclass__ = OPT_methods(form_type)

no no arg needed because we determine the type depending on the bases of the class


if form is of

1) form_type = 'SS' type, then we don't need to recalculate all the sensitivity measures from scratch


2) form_type = 'rhoDFIIt', 'modal_delta', 'LGS' then we recalculate all from scratch

the following methods are defined by the metaclass, and differ depending on the form_type

_iterate_form = 

                - _iterate_form_SS
                - _iterate_form_rhoDFIIt


_iterate_sens(type, list_of_sens, plant=None)

 - _iterate_sens_scratch (if form_type == 'rhoDFIIt' or any form that has no transformation process from one sensitivity measurement to another in new base)


On the basis of argument given to the metaclass, what's inside the method will change
