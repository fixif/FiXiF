Instructions for tentative compiling of wrapper on otherOS (MacOsX)

To compile the wrapper the following conditions have to be met :

Sucessful compilation of library libwcpg.so
Presence of liblapacke.so on the system in directory /usr/lib

The user must copy libwcpg.so in the current directory LTI/WCPG_wrapper
(libwcpg is located in Autotools/.libs/libwcpg.so)

Then run the script ./run_me.sh

Details of steps involved if bash not present on machine :

the script run_me does the following :

remove contents of ./build (clean state)
remove wrapper in current dir (_pyWCPG.so)

execute python build setup script
 - python setup.py build_ext --inplace --rpath=$CURRENTDIR
 
 the rpath option is very important as it enables setup to find libwcpg in current directory ($CURRENTDIR)
 
 
If lib dependencies are not met, the user will have to modify the setup.py to accomodate for library locations because the options here are passed to compiler and linker.
