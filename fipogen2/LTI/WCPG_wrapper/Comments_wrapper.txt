The wrapper was started with the example from 

http://dan.iel.fm/posts/python-c-extensions/

But there were many differences.

First memory model in Python seems to work better when you let it do its own thing.

So INCREC/DECREC is not to be used in many cases :

- "borrowed" references that are already references in the python code
- C-references which are going, anyway to disappear as soon as we leave the .so execution space

So we let python manage all the references, trash whatever.

But, at the same time we have to build a return value. The macros did not seem to work correctly so a memcpy, with the right data, will do the trick.

All functions in python work by receiving and emitting a tuple of args, and itself.
