\begin{command}[@FWR/realize]{realize}	\desc{Purpose}Numerically compute the outputs, states and intermediate variables with a given input U.Floating-point is used for the computations.	\desc{Syntax}\matlab{[Y, X, T] = realize( R, U, X0)}	\desc{Parameters}		\begin{tabular}{l@{\ :\ }p{9cm}}\matlab{Y} &  outputs                    \\\matlab{X} &  states                     \\\matlab{T} &  intermediate variables     \\\matlab{R} &  FWR object                 \\\matlab{U} &  inputs                     \\\matlab{X0} &  initial states (default=0)\\		\end{tabular}	\desc{Description}This function could be useful to evaluate the magnitude values of the intermediate variables and the states.\\It could also be useful to compare two different realizations, for example a realization and its quantized one.\\It is important to notice that the computations are done in floating-point (the fixed-point implementation is not considered here).\end{command}
