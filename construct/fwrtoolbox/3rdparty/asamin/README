asamin.c provides a MATLAB mex file that serves as gateway to Adaptive
Simulated Annealing (ASA) by Lester Ingber. The copyright of the
computer codes in this package belong to me, Shinichi Sakata. I assume
no responsibility for any damages or loss caused by the codes.

-------------
 Limitations
-------------

The current version of ASAMIN is written for MATLAB 6.1. It probably
works with some earlier and newer versions of MATLAB. 

ASAMIN is written in ANSI C. I do not think that the code much depends
on my particular environment. The gcc compiler version 2.95.4, which
is called by cmex (or mex), compiles it on my Pentinum III box running
Debian Linux 3.0. Some people have also reported that ASAMIN can be
compiled and used with MATLAB 6.1 on Windows 2000. But I would like to
stress that I myself only tested ASAMIN with MATLAB 7.0.0.19901 (R14)
on Debian Linux 3.0.

The current version of ASAMIN has been tested with ASA v. 25.15. It
may not work with older / future versions of ASA. ASA offers an array
of compilation-time options. ASAMIN only covers a particular setup
found in Makefile. If you need other setups, you may need to modify
ASAMIN.

--------------------------------
 Installation on UNIX platforms
--------------------------------

1. Obtain an archive of ASA from http://www.ingber.com and put the
   files in the archive in a work directory.

2. Copy asa.c, asa.h, and asa_usr_asa.h to the directory of ASAMIN.

3. Edit Makefile to reflect your C compiler. (You may also need to
   configure your mex options. See your MATLAB manual.)

4. Move to the directory of ASAMIN, if you haven't. Make ASAMIN by
   typing make.

5. Starting MATLAB in the same directory, run asatest, which yields
   asatest1.log and asatest2.log. Verify that the results in these log
   files are the same as that in test_asa in the ASA package.

6. Move the mex file of ASAMIN (e.g., asamin.mexglx) and asamin.m to a
   directory in the search list of MATLAB. (Read the output of 'help
   path' and 'help addpath' in MATLAB, if you don't know what the
   search list is.)

-----------------------------------
 Installation on Windows Platforms
-----------------------------------

The information in this section came from some users of ASAMIN. I have
not tested it myself, though your feedback would be welcomed.

1. Obtain an archive of ASA from http://www.ingber.com and put the
   files in the archive in a work directory.

2. Copy asa.c, asa.h, and asa_usr_asa.h to the directory of ASAMIN.

3. Move to the directory of ASAMIN, if you haven't. Type in

     mex asamin.c asa.c -DUSER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST#TRUE -DUSER_ASA_OUT#TRUE

   If your compiler complains that DBL_MIN is undefined, try 
   adding a switch "-DDBL_MIN#2.2250738585072014e-308".

4. Starting MATLAB in the same directory, run asatest, which yields
   asatest1.log and asatest2.log. Verify that the results in these log
   files are the same as that in test_asa in the ASA package.

5. Move the mex file of ASAMIN and asamin.m to a
   directory in the search list of MATLAB. (Read the output of 'help
   path' and 'help addpath' in MATLAB, if you don't know what the
   search list is.)

 Usage
-------

The file asamin.m describes the basic usage. A simple example is found
asatest.m. See test_cost_func1.m and test_cost_func2.m to learn how to
write the objective function.

Asamin has quite a few run-time options, reflecting those provided by
ASA. What these options do are found in ASA-README included in the ASA
package.
