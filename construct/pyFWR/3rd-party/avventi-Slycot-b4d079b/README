Python wrapper for selected SLICOT routines, notably including solvers for
Riccati, Lyapunov and Sylvester equations.


Prerequisite:
-------------

You will need Numpy, a fortran compiler such as gfortran and BLAS/LAPACK 
libraries for building Slycot.

On Debian derivates you can install all the above with a single command:

# apt-get build-dep python-scipy


Installing:
-----------

Unpack to a directory of your choice, say /path/to/slycot_src/, and execute:

$ cd /path/to/slycot_src/
# python setup.py install

Where # is for commands that needs to be executed as root/administrator. 
If the build fails and you are on a 64bit OS you may want to try

$ cd /path/to/slycot_src/
$ python setup.py config_fc --arch="-march=x86-64" build
# python setup.py install


To-Do:
------
 
- write unit tests
- add examples in the doc-strings
