/** @brief For an LTI filter given in its State-Space representation {A,B,C,D},
where A is n*n, B is n*q, C is p*n and D is p*q real matrix the function 
returns integer value indicating if WCPG was successfully computed.
In p*q matrix W the Worst-Case peak gain is stored if algorithm successfully exited.
Input:
	A, B, C, D - pointers for double arrays representing filter in state-space realization
	n, p, q - order of filter, number of inputs and number of outputs respectively
	W (output) - if function succeeds, on the output will hold the p*q size WCPG matrix of the filter {A,B,C,D}
				space for W is assumed to be preallocated outside the function
Output:
	integer value equal to 1 if WCPG computation is successful and 0 otherwise.

/** @brief Nth order LTI filter is represented by its transfer function numerator (array of size Nb) and
denumerator (array of size Na), where N := max(Na, Nb).
For such a filter, the function computes its WCPG in double precision
(i.e. such that the absolute error of WCPG computation is bounded by 2^53).
Input:
	num - pointer for the array holding numerator coefficients, sizeof(num) must be Nb
	denum - pointer for the array holding denumerator coefficients, sizeof(denum) must be Na
	W(output) - if function succeeds, on the output will hold the WCPG of filter represented with transfer function num/denum
				space for W is assumed to be preallocated outside the function
Output:
	integer value equal to 1 if WCPG computation is successful and 0 otherwise.
