Matlab example file, which generates a LWDF filter structure for a 5th order butterworth filter.
-------------
In order to run the file youâ€™ll need LWDF2SIF, which I had sent you earlier, and wdf_toolbox (which generates LWDFs), info about which you can find here http://ens.ewi.tudelft.nl/~huib/mtbx/get_files_ga_ens.php
